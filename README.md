This study combines EMARM, WINGS, TAHDT, and MICMAC methods to propose an integrated multidimensional analytical model for maritime accident analysis. Firstly, the EMARM algorithm is developed to mine maritime accident data from different watchkeeping periods, revealing Enhanced Multilevel Association Rules (EMARs) among the RIFs. Secondly, the WINGS is established in a data-driven manner and utilized to determine the reason and centrality degrees, as well as the weight of the RIFs, enabling an in-depth analysis of their causal relationships.  Following this, the improved TAHDT approach is utilised to uncover internal linkages among RIFs and delineate their logical hierarchical structures. Finally, the MICMAC method is used to calculate the driving force and dependency of each RIF, followed by a classification analysis.  This study identifies the key RIFs affecting maritime accidents across different watchkeeping periods through multidimensional analyses, and provides tailored recommendations to enhance navigation safety specific to each watchkeeping period.
